#Suduko_solver

V1 - First try 
I programmed this to solve sodukos as I would.
This is buy starting with the number 1 and removing all the tiles where it is impossile to go. And then if there is only 1 option left in a row/column/square, place the number there

This works for hard problems but not expert, as when completing harder sudukos, more than one number needs to be considered at the same time

V2 - Second try - using backtracking and recursion
Created after some research
Works for all solutions (by brute force)
